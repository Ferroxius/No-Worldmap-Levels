A simple mod that hides the recommended level indicator in the worldmap.

Designed to be used with mods like Geralt Level Scales (https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3961)

# Compatability
This mod modifies panel_worldmap.redswf meaning any other mods that also modify this file will be incompatible unless I make an adaptation of it

Currently the following mods have adaptations for them (You do not require the main mod when using an adaptation)
- All Quest Objectives On Map
- Colored Map Markers

# Installation
Drag and drop modWorldmapLevels into your mods folder

If you are using All Quest Objectives or Colored Map Markers then use the appropriate adaptation rather than the main file

# Uninstallation
Take modNoWorldmapLevels out of your mods folder

# Credits
- Wolfmark for All Quest Objectives files
- DJ_Kovrik for Colored Map Markers files
